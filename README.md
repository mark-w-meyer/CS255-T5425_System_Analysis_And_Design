# CS255-T5425_System_Analysis_And_Design
This is a portfolio submission for Southern New Hampshire University regarding the System Analysis and Design course, CS305-T5425

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client is DriverPass. The purpose of this project is to help new drivers pass their driving tests. The client wants this system to provide an interface to prepare new drivers with the training and capacity to pass their driving exams by giving students online and offline access to training material as well as real hands-on training with experienced driving trainers.

What did you do particularly well?
What I did particularly well was gathering functional and non-functional requirements from the client, assessing and analyzing the clients needs, identifying key components, designing the system that caters to those needs, then presenting the system using non-technical jargon in a way the client can understand its value.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could choose one part of my work to revise, I would choose to revise the "Reset Password UML activity diagram". There is an activity that says "User provides new password to DriverPass or IT Admin". This was an oversight on my part, but a user would never actually provide a password to anyone. Whether it is the system or the IT Admin providing the password reset, the password would be reset with a link sent to their email where the user could enter and verify the new password themselves.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
To interpret the user's needs and implement them into my system design, I went through the interview transcript with a fine-toothed comb and identified each and every requirement. From there, I separated the requirements into the categories 'functional' and 'non-functional'. Once this was done, I was able to utilize these focal points in creating a Use Case Diagram and a UML Class Diagram. These diagrams were the bread and butter of conveying the system design because they help identify key states and relationships between use cases, system objects, and end users. It is very important to consider the user's needs when designing because the value of a system is only as good as the value a user places on that system.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
My approach to designing software is that the client needs are the pivot point. This is why agile software methodology is a growing and successful mechanism: clients are human and they do not know what they want until they want it. This is why they come to you for the design: they only have an idea of what they want. Thus, the strategy I would use in the future to analyze and design a system would be to keep an open communication channel so that the client's needs are taken seriously and can be addressed at the moment of change. This will do well to minimize impediments and maximize production efficiency.
